        <h1>10 most important things</h1>
        <h2>10. Trust systems for the automated age.</h2>
        <p>The current most important systems for creating common perception and trust between peers are media (media conglomerats) and science (scientific method). Media is mostly an industrial age product and science, even if it has deeper roots, likewise a product of its time. There is a grave need for systems of mutual trust and collaborative learning for the automated age. </p>
        <h2>9. Lack of space technology</h2>
        <p>As the youngest person who has ever been outside the Earth’s gravity well turns well over 80, it’s becoming obvious that space technologies are not needed only for increasing the change of survival for human race, but also for shorter term goals such demonstrating the usefulness of science. There is a grave risk of apathy, even possibility of forgetting the early advances of space exploration, if humankind does not continue to advance this task. </p>
        <h2>8. End of capitalism</h2>
        <p>Due to energy abundance, automation and economies of scale, the marginal costs of products are becoming almost zero. This means that it does not make sense to sell them. While most tasks in middle class jobs are automated, there is an increasing competition for low paid jobs, increasingly reducing the salaries in the lowest paid job markets. The diminishing added value in products then keeps them affordable for the low paid labor, but renders selling and transporting these products outside the scope of meaningful market operations. Furthermore, the stagnating economy requires more and more central bank issued loans without the ability to pay them back. To fix these issues, a global payback of debt will be issued at the time when there are sufficient number of postmoney features available to induce ad hoc trust between collaborators.</p>
        <h2>7. Energy abundance</h2>
        <p> in poor countries leading to disruptance in global production and logistic chains. </p>
        <h2>6. Biological extremenism</h2>
        <p>With novel “home ready” gene therapy technologies such as cripsr/cas9 it is possible to radically copy and paste different existing genetic features to different gene series, allowing not only changing one’s natural hair color, but also targeted poisons and body hacking in an completely unseen scale. </p>
        <h2>5. Casual use of Nuclear weapons</h2>
        <p> When the autonomous warfare becomes more and more common, those lacking AI skills and robotics industry might need to scale back to more traditional means of deterrance. In this case, using nuclear weapons not against people but against machines (also due to the fact that a nuclear blast creates EMP pulses paralyzing unprotected machines) might reduce the barrier for other parties to use these weapons against the first initiator. Further, there is a plausible mad man scenario of a nuclear weapon use, where tensions in some region are reduced by shooting an nuclear strike against a less relevant, neutral side to demonstrate that a nuclear strike is a possibility. This again could loop out of control.  </p>
        <h2>4. Sociocultural effects of Global Warming.</h2>
        <p>As global warming continues, challenging international collaboration in the short stints of nationalism and deglobalisation, it might seem to be an impossible problem to solve, leading to a widening apathy and end of the world attitudes. The issue is not really global warming, but these attitudes that enhance it. </p>
        <h2>3. Fragile technosocial development</h2>
        <p>Due to brain plasticity, a human quickly learns to use tools. This is typically beneficial but might be threatening if the tools are sensitive or fragile to change. In the case of networked knowledge (search engines) and perception (from digital maps to AR), the sudden disappearance of these tools might prove to be an existential risk.</p>
        <h2>2. Inevitable lost of privacy due to enhancing capabilities</h2>
        <p> Technology enhances our capabilities, but due to the enhanced capabilities to do bad things to massive number of people, there is no alternative to giving up privacy, preferably to a group of elected officials.</p>
