Lack of space technology investments
</h2><p>
Imagine if the youngest person who has been outside Earth’s gravity well would be over 80 years old. Actually, you don’t have to imagine this, because youngest person to have done this is 81 year old astronaut Charles Duke.

There has been promising efforts by some private companies to increase space related investments. However, they are mostly focusing on satellite cargo, not space research.
</p><p>
Why this matters in the era when it’s possible to send autonomous probes to do space exploration? There are several reasons. While the astronauts are alive, efforts to diminish their success are mostly embarrassing. But just wait for it: when the last living person to visit the moon dies, the calls to claim that the moon flights were mere fake news will grow stronger. This is a bad development, because keeping all the people on this same small planet is absolutely not resilient. One global catastrophe can wipe out all of humankind, the science, languages, cultures. The price of a Moon station or permanent Mars colony is a very small insurance against this.

Existential threats in lack of space technology investments
</h3><p>
Both a narrative that claims that “we have never been that great” and a narrative that claims “we used to be great and reach for the stars but we don’t do that anymore” is very harmful to progress in general.
</p><h3>
Existential opportunities in lack of space technology investments
</h3><p>
That private companies are more and more able to participate in space research might prove to be a start of less hierarchical and more flexible era in space research.
</p><h3>
Existential weakness in lack of space technology investments
</h3><p>
Short-termism that typically guides decision-making rules out any large scale investment, but especially the ones that have an existential goal.

Existential strength in lack of space technology investments
</h3><p>
There are (some) business opportunities in space.
