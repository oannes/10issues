<h2>New trust and information systems</h3>
<p>
The industrial age systems to produce mutual information and social trust, namely media arranged in conglomerates and science according to the reductionist scientific method, are facing more and more issues and criticism. There is a grave risk that large groups of people completely abandon these systems if they can’t reinvent themselves for the more connected and transparent times.
</p><p>
The new systems that transcend the current ones should not completely disregard the old ways, especially regarding the scientific method. Nevertheless, a new, more participatory and holistic layer should be added both to increase relevance and keep on doing science for it’s own sake. It’s especially problematic that media and science are often considered ends in themselves while for the most people they are means to different outcomes, such as entertainment, information and knowledge, understanding, curiosity, social coherence, norms, or technological capabilities. The new systems are providing better means to achieve some of these outcomes.
