<h2>End of the Age of Gun</h2>

<p>What if a Mexican drug lord constructs a huge drone army to fight against anyone challenging power over his territories and people? If he manages to do this, he does not have to trust anyone, anymore.
</p><p>In the middle ages a horse archer and a knight were superior fighting machines. A very few people had the change to purchase a horse and suit of armour. Thus, there was a significant imbalance of power. For several hundred years, this has not been the case: crystallized in the polemic second amendment in the US constitution, the ability and right to bear arm made it possible for the peasants to stand against their oppressors.
</p><p>But the age of the gun has ended. Previously, a number of liberties were provided to many due to the fact that oppressors had to please the masses which were quick to learn how to use guns against their lords if needed. When this is no longer the case, it’s possible that these liberties diminish.
</p><h3>Existential threats in the End of the Age of Gun</h3>
<p>Few people, perhaps leaders of advanced nation states, rich individuals or CEOs in oppressive companies, can repress large group of people with expensive autonomous violence machines. Further, the introduction of autonomous violence machines in warfare might reduce the barrier of war because no human casualties would occur in field operations for the automated party.
<h3>Existential opportunities in the End of the Age of Gun</h3>
<p>New technologies sometimes make capabilities more equal: it’s possible that open sourced violence machines liberate people to an even more equal balance on the ability to conduct acts of violence.
</p><h3>Existential weakness in the End of the Age of Gun</h3>
<p>Emergence of machine learning technologies and ability to construct massively destructive weapons make building autonomous violence machines possible.
</p><h3>Existential strength in the End of the Age of Gun</h3>
<p>Reduction of the costs from building war machines is shrinking, providing many the opportunity to partake in owning autonomous violence machines. The open source culture can be the medium for sharing good enough designs for resistance to be possible. 2nd amendment in US constitution provide means to have a conversation about the solutions to maintain the democratizing structures from the age of the gun in the new era.
