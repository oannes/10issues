      <h2>I’m curious. What is this?</h2>
      <p>
      This is an up to date list of humankind’s 10 most important struggles. <a href="../10issues/changelog/">Check out the old versions and explanations of the changes</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This list of 10 challenges might seem somewhat atypical. This is because importance of items on the list is estimated based on their impact on our collective capabilities to solve problems (<a href="">see model</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
      The goal of the list is to encourage forward-thinking agenda on each of the issues in hand, instead of simply struggling to maintain the current situation. I don’t want to conserve the climate, or conserve humanism. I want to make the climate better; to trancend humanism. The required improvements happen when enough many people do little things for them to happen, not when someone does a big thing. 
      </p>
      <p>
      So, what should you do? Pick one item on the list, and do something.

        <h3>1 Wisdom of the crowd after the age of gun</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: Decline in freedom to collaborate
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 60%+-20 in 10 years. <a href="../10issues/ageofgun.html">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        A knight was superior fighting machine in the middle ages. A very few people had the change to purchase a horse and suit of armor. Thus, feudal lords had absolute power. For several hundred years, this has not been the case: crystallized in the polemic second amedment in the US constitution, the ability and right to bear arm in combination with mass production of weaponry made it possible for the peasants to stand against their oppressors with just a short training. This shift in power towards a common man made democratic participation possible, which lead to schools, women in the workforce and a whole lot more meritocratic society. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, imagine a super rich drug lord with a private, amoral drone army. There’s an estimated 60% possibility (<a href="../10issues/ageofgun.html">why?</a>) that super wealthy individuals are able to purchase means of oppression that free them from maintaining trust to people around them. The power division returns to the feudal order. This has a significant impact on participation, collaboration, and freedom of most of us. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? Legislative changes can hinder the development, especially introducing Asimov laws in all machinery. Another path forward is developing other, more democratic means of armed resistance to maintain the balance of power in the new technological landscape.

        <h3>2 Stagnation of taboes and total social control in the society without privacy</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: Stagnation
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 65%+-10 in 10 years. <a href="../10issues/lostofprivacy">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        The increase in hyperconnected sensors, data and machine learning leads to a society where it’s cheap, convenient and typical to know almost everything about everyone’s actions. There’s an estimated 65% probability (<a href="../10issues/lostofprivacy">why?</a>) that this causes a stagnation of social order and hinders most radical ideas, in addition to supporting submissive belief systems such as religions due to lack of anonymity. Anonymous arguments, ideas that don’t fit to the personal brand of their creator, and cheating of spouses becomes impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main reason that causes the lack of privacy is the fact that increasing technological opportunities, such as manufacturing viruses, need to be controlled: technology enhances our capabilities, but due to the enhanced capabilities to do bad things to massive number of people, there is no alternative to giving up privacy. Although preferably the rights of control would be given to a group of elected officials, the “big brother”, it’s more efficient and cheap to create a culture of “any brother”.
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? Supporting services that enable throwaway identities, or hidden identities, and supporting mass-scale cryptography, is a good start. But the problem is normative, not technological. A way forward could be creating new concepts and language that provides safe spaces for undefined actions.

        <h3>3 Increasing fragility of technopsychological organs</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: Disruptions
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 90%+-5 that significant disruptions happen in the next 10 years. <a href="../10issues/technosocialdevelopment.html">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        “First we shape the tools and then the tools shape us.” A human is an organism that moves with two feet, two wheels, or four wheels, remembers with a brain-computer combination, communicates by speech or electric signals and learns by saving information in brain or in any other concrete matter. Due to brain plasticity, a human quickly learns to use tools: the tools a human uses become a part of the human. This is typically beneficial but might be threatening if the tools are sensitive or fragile to change, and especially when one tool is shared with almost all the people. In the case of networked knowledge (search engines) and perception (from digital maps to AR), the sudden disappearance of these tools might cause significant disruptions in the daily lives of people. The probability of such a collapse of a single tool is estimated to be around 90% for the next 10 years. Nevertheless, these disruptions are not estimated to cause existential risk just yet. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? Demand and create more decentralized systems in data storage, data processing, energy harvesting and saving and food and water production. Mesh networks, edge computing, decentralized solar and batteries, and vertical and local farming are promising initiatives.

        <h3>4 Sociocultural apathy due to global warming</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: partial paralysis
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 65%+-5 in the next 10 years. <a href="../10issues/socialglobalwarming.html">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        If we believe that we are the second to last generation, why would anything matter? 
        </p>
        <p>
          After the world war, arts turned to insanity of dada and meaninglessness of postmodernism. Arts and entertainment often function as a echo chamber for the society, reinforcing a chosen path. Imagine the cynical, apathetic, destructive art of the 2020s if global warming gains pace while nation states still remain motionless and still, unable to act in the biggest tragedy of commons humankind has seen. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For the next 10 or 25 years, global warming is not on the top of the list in terms of direct impact. That’ll come later. But if no action is made, and the apathetic and apocalyptic mindset gains ground, our abilities to act to fix global warming, and to reach all the other goals, are seriously damaged. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? Demonstrate hope in concrete terms. Show visions of otherness where fixing global warming has helped the societies in other ways too. Create platforms for activism and forums for optimistic policy discussions.

        <h3>5 Decline of humanism</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: Slow decline
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 25%+-10 that human rights are significantly diminished globally during the next 10 years, and estimated 60%+-10 that if this replacement happens, it is a return to a more patriarchical belief system. <a href="">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Humanism has been a prime mover of giving more people opportunities to participate in common discussions. Recently, it has worked well in nation states that provide these rights to the people, and companies. It has, however, been struggling in families, where many grave for a return to a more traditional form. Birth rates are lower in families where humanism is the prime belief system instead of religious or other beliefs. Furthermore, the discussion regarding humanism has intensified, stripping it slowly from the position of the naturalized belief system it has had for a relatively long time in Global North. These developments will eventually lead to a crisis in humanist thought. There’s an estimated 25% change that this crisis erupts already during the next 10 years in the form of a strong antihumanist movement (such as fascist futurists in 1930s Italy). 
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? There’s also a small change that humanism is replaced by a belief system that allows for even more collaboration, freedom of thought and self-reinforcement. I estimate a 5% opportunity for a new renessaince – a global progressive posthumanist movement. The characteristics of this movement should be moving even further to maximizing participation, collaboration and curiosity of all. Possible directions include looking at roles of a person, or according to process philosophy, the connections between people, instead of the person as herself.

        <h3>6 Casual use of nukes</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: a partial or complete destruction of humankind
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 15%+-15 that complete cities are destroyed and 40% that nukes are used in the battlefield during the next 10 years. <a href="">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Use of nuclear weapons remain a concrete, tangible and possible event. Their use causes an existential threat to the global civilization. The situation regarding the use of nukes is also drastically changing. The robotization of the military forces lowers the barrier of use, because there might be tactical reasons in creating electromagnetic pulses to stop robot armies in advancing. There are even situations where these kind of tactical strikes would not cause large number of casualties directly. However, they would lower the barrier of use which has so far been very high. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Especially worrying is the option to de-escalate conflicts with random nuke strikes to neutral parties to demonstrate that the warring party is ready to use nukes. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? Nuclear disarmament has long and sometimes even successful activist tradition. Counterintuitively, it could be also best to support as many conflicts as possible. That is, to support a world where conflicts are abundant but where they are always minor and unconnected to other conflicts. Further, moving away from nation states, and supporting military alliances only for countries that don’t have nukes, is one direction. Furhermore, travelling to countries that have nukes and which are considered hostile, be it USA, Pakistan, India or Israel, and meeting and befriending young and promising people in these countries, will slightly limit the risk.

        <h3>7 Frankenstein’s monsters: growth in biological inequality</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: less capabilities, and less diversity in ideas
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
        Probability estimation: 95%+-5% that biological inequality grows measurably during the next 10 years. Small change for purposeful outbreak of targeted biological weapons of mass destruction. <a href="">Why?</a>  
        </p>
        <p>
        Traditionally, aristrocrats have thought that they are better people than the rest. But this has not been true, or at least there has been merely external factors such as better nutrition to blame from clear biological benefits. This changes. Soon, there are people who in fact are both more wealthy and more intelligent and strong and live longer than the rest of us. Does it really matter that the causality is the other way around than the well-off might want to think: being rich makes you bright. 
        </p>
        <p>
        How? Radical developments in gene editing (CripsR/Cas9) and data provide wealthy individuals unfair advantage over editing their offsprings and themselves. I have estimated that it is almost certain that biological inequality grows measurably during the next 10 years due to gene hacking, intelligence boosting and DNA doping. The impact of this can certainly be positive – inequality as such is not a problem if there’s a role for everybody. But how can superhumans avoid contempt and understand that there are more benefits in collaboration than in competition? And how can those who don’t have access to these tools find fareness and be willing to participate with these people. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What to do? Revealing the moral dilemme and discussing about it in the public sphere is the first step in solving this puzzle.

        <h3>8 Articifial scarcity in the abundant world</h3>
        <p class="bold">
        Impact: limits opportunities
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
          Probability estimation: 50%+-10. <a href="../10issues/scarcityinabundance.html">Why?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, there is artificial scarcity in food and by extension, in clean water. Due to energy abundance, automation and economies of scale, the marginal costs of products are becoming almost zero. This means that it does not make sense to sell them. While most tasks in middle class jobs are automated, there is an increasing competition for low paid jobs, further reducing the salaries in the lowest paid job markets. The diminishing added value in products then keeps them affordable for the low paid labor, but renders selling and transporting these products outside the scope of meaningful market operations. Furthermore, the stagnating economy requires more and more central bank issued loans without the ability to pay them back. To keep the current system going, an artificial scarcity will be introduced. But this is a wrong action. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why humankind cannot reap the fruits of the abundance. Religions are strongly fine-tuned for a nonabundant world, strongly encouraging modesty. Climate change puts us in the position where it’s difficult to understand what is abundant and what actually more scarce than before. Nonetheless, the worst reason to avoid abundance is to try to conserve the industrial era structures of mass-consumption and mass-production.  They would encourage creating artificially abundant goods, such as virtual goods. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What to do? Actively imagine alternative world orders that stem from abundant energy but not abundant production.

          <h3>
            9 Lack of postindustrial institutions, especially regarding trust 
          </h3>
          <p class="bold">
            Impact: stagnation
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            Probability estimation: 80%.  <a href="../10issues/postindustrialinstitutions.html">Why?</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            After industrial revolution, it took almost a hundred years before the workers were able to benefit from the productivity gains. After growing inequality and horrible working conditions, workers were able to organize themselves and modern taxation, unions, the welfare state and other industrial era social innovations were born out of that debate. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, the change must happen quicker. Although almost all institutions are likely to change in the postindustrial era, I want to focus on the change of industrial era institutions of trust: the media and science (the scientific method). Media is mostly an industrial age product and science, even if it has deeper roots, likewise a product of its time. Both are rapidly losing their exceptionalist status: according to a Bayer lab metaresearch, 90% of medical research results are questionable. Fake news are everywhere. Clearly, there is a grave need for systems of mutual trust and collaborative learning for the automated age. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important institutional shift which lacks answer is the shift of cumulation. In the industrial era, the cumulation of capital and production capability largely dictated the social system’s core characteristics. In the post-industrial era, these are not the bottlenecks, although both of them have a role. In large part the sharing of industrial era gains for workers took a long time because there wasn’t a method of measuring productivity. So what is the asset which we cannot currently fully measure? One alternative is the value of free time or waiting, based on the absurb conceptialization of time leading to constant perception of being busy which poisons the wellbeing of a modern person. 
          </p>
          <p>
            What to do? Set up and experiment with completely new institutions and concepts such as social platforms, data taxes and previously unseen ways of conceptualizing the “spending” of time.

          <h3>10 From the space age back to savannah</h3>
          <p class="bold">
            Impact: lack of perceived opportunities
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            Probability estimation: 90% +-5 that no living person has been outside the earths gravity well in 10 years. <a href="../10issues/nospaceage.html">Why?</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            As the youngest person who has ever been outside the Earth’s gravity well turns well over 80, it’s becoming obvious that space technologies are not needed only for increasing the change of survival for human race, but also for shorter term goals such demonstrating the usefulness of science. There is a grave risk of apathy, even possibility of forgetting the early advances of space exploration, if humankind does not continue to advance this task.
          </p>
          <p>
            What to do? Demand more space research with a goal of establishing permanent settlement on the Moon and terraforming Mars. Don’t trust foreign public institutions to do this, but also find ways to support these explorations via other mechanisms such as co-ops and markets.
