<h2>Energy abundance in Global South</h2>
<p>
There are historical reasons why countries in the Global North are leading in GDP, education, innovation and other metrics (a part of these reasons is that the people in these countries decided upon which metrics to follow in the first place). But it’s quite possible that countries near the equator, coincidentally also most affected by global warming, are the ones to catch up very quickly due to technological reasons.
</p><p>
This is because solar power prices are already cheaper than any other form of electricity production in these areas. For example Morocco, equipped with a power cable connection to the power hungry Europe, is estimated to produce whopping 40% of their electricity with solar panels already in 2020.

Solar is also different from traditional “strategic” forms of power generation. Generating power from coal, uranium or oil requires a lot of strategic assets, such as mines, wells, and power plants. But solar power can be produced anywhere. The energy abundance paired with increasingly capable 3D printers and other precision tools might make these countries small scale production powerhouses.

The change in global logistics chains and in global power balance is so significant that there are major risks as well. For example, the Russian influence via oil and gas will diminish which might severely hurt their current claim to become a global influencer.

Existential threats in energy abundance in global south
</h3><p>
Current strong players using their resources to stop the development which benefits mostly relatively poor and small countries.
</p><h3>
Existential opportunities in energy abundance in global south
</h3><p>
Rise of Sub-Saharan Africa and acceleration of the rise of South American nations would significantly increase the living standards of billions of people.
</p><h3>
Existential weakness in energy abundance in global south
</h3><p>
Global energy production system and logistics chains is not built for the opportunity.
</p><h3>
Existential strength in energy abundance in global south
</h3><p>
Due to the nonstrategic nature of solar power the increase in energy production capability can be done via people and markets instead of large infrastructure investments that are prone to corruption and resource curses.
