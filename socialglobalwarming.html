<h2>Sociocultural effects of Global Warming</h2>
<p>
What if USA withdraws from the climate agreement, framing it as fake news, and at the same time the alarming temperatures in the poles continue to rise. Would you feel devastated?
</p><p>
Global warming is the most evident self-inflicted long term risk our planet faces. It is also a global challenge level of which has never been seen before. Due to the huge complexity in decision making regarding the issue, there will be apathy and public recant. If the sentiment that the warming is already impossible to fix increases, the end of the world attitude might lead to bizarre sociocultural behaviours.

Existential threats in sociocultural effects of Global Warming
</h3><p>
If the climate change denialists move directly from “it’s not true” to “it’s already too late”, the existential risk of the climate change might realize faster than it would only from the climate perspective. The end of the world attitudes might increase the risks of major wars, immoral behavior and widespread depression.
</p><h3>
Existential opportunities in sociocultural effects of Global Warming
</h3><p>
If successful, the climate change induced global reactions would be the first time when humankind demonstratedly would have collaborated together successfully. It would be a very good start for other large scale projects not only in risk management but also in mutual opportunities.
</p><h3>
Existential weakness in sociocultural effects of Global Warming
</h3><p>
The argument is balanced unfairly: there is no sense of urgency, there are short term benefits in opposing global collaboration, the scientific community is still shy to pronounce possible effects of climate change to normal people and so on.
</p><h3>
Existential strength in sociocultural effects of Global Warming
</h3><p>
There is no way around the argument that swift action is required even in the most hopeless situations.
