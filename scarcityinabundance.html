<h2>Economy fading out</h2>

<p>
Due to energy abundance, automation and economies of scale, the marginal costs of products are becoming almost zero. While most tasks in middle class jobs are automated, there is an increasing competition for low paid jobs, increasingly reducing the salaries in the lowest paid job markets. The diminishing added value in products then keeps them affordable for the low paid labor, but renders selling and transporting these products outside the scope of meaningful market operations.

<p>Large scale disruptions in global monetary system can cause suffering. For example, if USA would claim that they are not going to pay their foreign debt, a systemic collapse of all the banks could occur, rendering all the debt and savings obsolete. Most people would benefit from this in the longer run, but there are no substitute systems in the society to provide the basic needs, so a societal paralysis could occur.

<p>Soon there might be sufficient number of postmoney features available to induce ad hoc trust between collaborators and to get rid of money as trust medium.
</p><h3>Existential weakness in economy fading out
</h3><p>The networked global economy can fail simultaneously everywhere even due to a relatively minor reason in a particular market.

</h3><p>As economy is merely a human system, simply continuing to work normally even if there wouldn’t be money in the society would work.

<h2>Energy abundance in Global South</h2>
<p>
There are historical reasons why countries in the Global North are leading in GDP, education, innovation and other metrics (a part of these reasons is that the people in these countries decided upon which metrics to follow in the first place). But it’s quite possible that countries near the equator, coincidentally also most affected by global warming, are the ones to catch up very quickly due to technological reasons.
</p><p>
This is because solar power prices are already cheaper than any other form of electricity production in these areas. For example Morocco, equipped with a power cable connection to the power hungry Europe, is estimated to produce whopping 40% of their electricity with solar panels already in 2020.
</p><p>
Solar is also different from traditional “strategic” forms of power generation. Generating power from coal, uranium or oil requires a lot of strategic assets, such as mines, wells, and power plants. But solar power can be produced anywhere. The energy abundance paired with increasingly capable 3D printers and other precision tools might make these countries small scale production powerhouses.
</p><p>
The change in global logistics chains and in global power balance is so significant that there are major risks as well. For example, the Russian influence via oil and gas will diminish which might severely hurt their current claim to become a global influencer.

Rise of Sub-Saharan Africa and acceleration of the rise of South American nations would significantly increase the living standards of billions of people.

Global energy production system and logistics chains is not built for the opportunity.

Due to the nonstrategic nature of solar power the increase in energy production capability can be done via people and markets instead of large infrastructure investments that are prone to corruption and resource curses.
