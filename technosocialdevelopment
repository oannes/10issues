<h2>Fragility of techno-social development</h2>
<p>
Imagine what if one day, when you wake up, you realise that your phone hasn’t charged the previous night. The lights don’t work. As there is no connectivity, you can’t google what you should do.

There are two parody images of the good old Maslow hierarchy. In the first, below the most basic needs, there is a text in big green letters that says “wifi”. In another, there is a text under the wifi text. It says “battery life”. Due to brain plasticity people are really fast at learning how to use new tools. But as McLuhan said: first we shape the tools and then the tools shape us. We grow to be dependent on our tools, such as internet search, mobile phones, digital maps and GPS, and soon augmented reality.

<h3>Existential threats in fragility of techno-social development</h3>
<p>
When the technology stack grows it becomes more and more fragile. A small problem in critical infrastructure can have horrifying side effects because we are not prepared to operate without our connected, electricity hungry tools.
</p><h3>Existential opportunities in fragility of techno-social development</h3>
<p>These tools, if functional, clearly make us trancend what we used to be.
</p><h3>Existential weakness in fragility of techno-social development</h3>
<p>The tools are dependent on each others and built on top of each others.
</p><h3>Existential strength in fragility of techno-social development
<p>Energy harvesting and (in broad sense) “mesh” networked infrastructure increases the resilience instead of reducing it.
